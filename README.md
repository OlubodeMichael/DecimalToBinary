# Decimal to Binary Conversion

The **Decimal to Binary Conversion** project is a C++ program that allows users to convert decimal numbers into their binary representations. The project employs stack and queue data structures to achieve this.

## Features

- **Decimal to Binary Conversion:** Users can input decimal numbers with both integer and fractional parts, and the program will convert them into binary.
- **Stack for Integer Part:** The integer part of the decimal is converted into binary using a stack, and the binary representation is displayed.
- **Queue for Fractional Part:** The fractional part of the decimal is converted into binary using a queue, with an option to specify the precision (number of binary places).
- **Command-Line Interface:** The user interacts with the program through the command line, providing input for conversion.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:** Compile and run the C++ program in your development environment.
2. **Input Decimal:** Enter the decimal number you want to convert.
3. **Specify Precision:** Optionally, specify the number of binary places for the fractional part.
4. **Get Binary Representation:** The program will display the binary representation for both the integer and fractional parts.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in C++ and consists of two classes: `Stack` and `Queue`. The `Stack` class handles the conversion of the integer part, while the `Queue` class is responsible for the fractional part. The user interacts with the program via the command line.
